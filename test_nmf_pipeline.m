% This is a script to run synthetic data through the NMF pipeline to
% validate the algorithm is working as expected. 4 "patterns" of firing
% rates will be generated from a log-normal distribution for 100 neurons.
% For each of trial, each time step will be a jittered pattern of the
% firing rate vector. There will be 20 trials per pattern and 30 time bins
% per trial of 10ms each. The noise added will be gaussian for now.
