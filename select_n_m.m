% Selects the optimal number of spatiotemporal modules.
% Input arguments:
%  X_train      - Training input matrix (size #cells
%                 x #time_points_per_trial * #training_set_trials)
%                 composed of horizontally concatenated population responses
%  groups_train - Class labels of each trial (e.g. stimulus identity);
%                 (vector of length #training_set_trials)
%  n_e_train    - Number of training set trials
%  X_test       - Test input matrix (size #cells
%                 x #time_points_per_trial * #test_set_trials)
%                 composed of horizontally concatenated population responses
